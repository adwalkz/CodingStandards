# CodingStandards

Hi Reader,

- You may have notice that, read someone else code is very annoying sometimes. This is because they are not following coding standards that you are.
- To deal with this problem there are coding standards for probably every programming language out there.
- We are lazy enough for not reading that boring and "very formal" doc.
- So the idea here is, I will write coding standards that I follow for each language I use and of course in a fun and easy to read way.

Have a look, I hope you will like it!
